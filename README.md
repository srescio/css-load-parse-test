# CSS load and parsing test

What is the best way organize CSS in order to get styled contents in the hands of mobile users as soon as possible? And same for desktop, how to avoid loading as less unnecessary styles as possible so that loading time is faster? And if not faster at least **applied** faster.

Google has legitimized the concept of "above the fold content" meaning having ASAP the code that builds up the topmost part of the page that is immediately available for the user to see something.
